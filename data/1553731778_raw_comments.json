The agency is expecting 55,000 families, including 40,000 children, to enter the process this month.\n\nMr. McAleenan warned earlier this month of a looming breaking point. \u201cThat breaking point has arrived,\u201d he said Wednesday.\n\nBorder Patrol agents in the Rio Grande Valley last week started releasing migrant families into the U.S., giving them a legal notice to report back to immigration authorities, instead of attempting to hand them off to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, due to crowded conditions in government facilities. The Border Patrol is now also releasing migrant families in San Diego; Yuma, Ariz.; and El Paso. They are considering doing the same in the Del Rio, Texas, sector.\n\nWhile overall arrests at the border had been declining in recent years as fewer single adults seek to enter the country, there has been a sharp increase in the number of adults with children who say they are fleeing violence in Central America.\n\nThe Border Patrol has limited ability to hold people. The stations were built to house single adults for just a few hours before they were deported, typically to Mexico, or handed off to immigration authorities. The cinder-block holding cells have no beds or showers and just a small sink and toilet only partially shielded for privacy.\n\nICE is responsible for accepting single adults and families transferred from Border Patrol. But it only has space to hold around 3,000 immigrants traveling as families at any one time. Those who arrive when the jails are full are generally released after a few days, with most adults outfitted with an electronic ankle bracelet to monitor their movements.\n\nNathalie Asher, the acting head of the enforcement and removals team at ICE, told reporters last week that around 107,000 families had been released into the interior in the past three months, including 1,000 in one day from the Rio Grande Valley. They are also given instructions to report back to immigration authorities after they have settled in the interior of the country.\n\nMr. McAleenan also said Wednesday that he was redirecting up to 750 officers from ports of entry to support the U.S. Border Patrol with processing and transporting migrants who arrive at other points on the border, including taking them to hospitals.\n\n\u201cIn the last four days, we have seen fevers of 105 [degrees] in infants, a two-year-old suffering from seizures in the desert, a 19-year-old woman with a congenital heart defect that needs emergency surgery, and a 40-year-old man suffering from multiorgan failure but trying to refuse medical care,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe are doing everything we can to simply avoid a tragedy in a CBP facility. But with these numbers, with the types of illnesses we are seeing, I fear it is just a matter of time,\u201d he added.\n\nTwo children have already died, and another migrant had a stillbirth, in U.S. custody, according to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nMr. McAleenan said that wait times and processing at the border would increase, including for trade and pedestrians.\n\nThe CBP commissioner said that the agencies need changes to the asylum and immigration legal framework that could only come from Congress. He and other Trump administration officials have demanded the closure of what they characterize as loopholes that encourage families to pursue asylum claims that are unlikely to succeed while remaining in the U.S.\n\nBut his blunt assessment of the consequences Wednesday was unusually stark, as was his description of problems throughout the system, including at other agencies with whom he is tasked with working.\n\nICE housed an average daily population of 2,246 people in family detention units in early February, according to the agency\u2019s own data. Ms. Asher said last week that her agency was considering changing configurations of several facilities, but hadn\u2019t reached a final decision.\n\nThe agency held approximately 43,000 single adult immigrants in early February in facilities that aren\u2019t set up for families, according to its data. The agency has some ability to add or move beds, but says that its exact capacity is proprietary information. Laws including the Prison Rape Elimination Act of 2003 restrict housing unrelated people of different genders and ages in close proximity.", "created_utc": 1553731883, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ejjc3wb", "link_id": "t3_b6bwi9", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_b6bwi9", "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/b6bwi9/us_border_chief_says_breaking_point_has_arrived/ejjc3wb/", "retrieved_on": 1553731884, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Conservative", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p"}, {"author": "wekafleckaflem", "author_flair_background_color": null, "author_flair_css_class": null, "author_flair_richtext": [], "author_flair_template_id": null, "author_flair_text": null, "author_flair_text_color": null, "author_flair_type": "text", "author_fullname": "t2_1wvthpzk", "author_patreon_flair": false, "body": "Both sides do this, prove me wrong ", "created_utc": 1553731778, "gildings": {"gid_1": 0, "gid_2": 0, "gid_3": 0}, "id": "ejjbyo7", "link_id": "t3_b650hr", "no_follow": true, "parent_id": "t3_b650hr", "permalink": "/r/Conservative/comments/b650hr/funny_how_it_is_conservatives_who_must_accept/ejjbyo7/", "retrieved_on": 1553731778, "score": 1, "send_replies": true, "stickied": false, "subreddit": "Conservative", "subreddit_id": "t5_2qh6p"}]
